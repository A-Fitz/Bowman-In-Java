There are two ways to run this.

1. Import the project into Eclipse and run it using application/Main.java
2. Use the supplied .jar file in release 1.0: “BowmanInJava.jar”. 
	If it does not open upon double clicking, open a command prompt, cd into the directory, 
	and type “java -jar BowmanInJava.jar”

Playing the game is simple. The default difficulty is Normal, but this can be changed in the Settings menu.
The same goes for Gravity, where its default is 9.80. The Sun can also be made to be an obstacle. To begin
a game, you must first provide a name and color for both Player 1 and Player 2. Each game starts with a 
welcome animation, previewing the distance that each player is from eachother. Player 1 always has the first
turn. Players take turns shooting at eachother with a magnitude and angle given by a click & drag. Different
difficulties change the amount of damage a player will take to different parts of their model. Once a player
reaches 0 health, the game is over.

# Class Project

## Overview

For your class project you will work on a small-scale (~ < 5 KLOC) project of your choosing.
This project should be large enough for a team size of three people to be adequately busy during
the course. The project should also be small enough to have a minimally viable product
completed by the end of the course. Since this may be your first experience working on software
development in teams, do your best to estimate the size of the project. It is not uncommon for
students to propose extremely large projects and then realize they are too large. In this scenario,
numerous lower-priority requirements can be left unimplemented. Keep in mind that a large
amount of time will be spent on requirements engineering and system design with only a few
weeks allocated for implementation. Something along the lines of a small desktop application is
expected.

There should be some need for the software project you choose to work on that addresses some
objective. In other words, try to avoid implementing an application that already exists. For
example, the computer game “Hearts” already exists and it would not be a good project to re-
implement it. “Do not reinvent the wheel”. However, if there are some deficiencies in existing
software, or missing features, re-implementing your own version with the new features would
make for a good project. I personally re-implemented the computer game “Clue”, because the
existing commercial version lacked strong AI players. As part of your project proposal, you will
do some research to see if/what existing solutions exist that are similar to the project you intend
to propose. The application can be anything of your within the constraints provided in this
document. I will give some potential project ideas in class.


## Software

There are imposed software constraints for this project. Developers on the same team should all
be using the same programming environment for consistency. A list of software constraints is
provided below.

1. Programming language: Java (JDK 10.0.x)
    a. Supplementary languages permitted as necessary
2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Eclipse (Eclipse Photon)
3. Bug tracking and project management system: Jira
4. Version control: Subversion
5. UML modeling tool: Rational Rhapsody
6. Document sharing: Google Docs

Any team collaboration software can be of your teams choosing. For example, Slack is a
common tool used for team collaboration. Video conferencing software is also your choice. The
university provides Skype for Business, which allows for video conferencing and screen sharing.

## Team Dynamics

Each team may implement their own internal processes, as long as the deliverables are met.
Teams are required to meet at least once a week in person for 1 hour. Additional or longer
meeting times are optionally determined by each team. The scheduled meeting times and
locations should be determined as soon as possible. Every team member should attend all
scheduled meetings unless there are exceptional circumstances.

## This is a team project. You should all work together a team. More proficient team members

should offer help to less proficient team members, but not do their work for them. Less
proficient team members should not be designated as “Pizza guy”. Less proficient team
members should attempt to improve their skills to help contribute to the team project. All team
members are required to their fair share of the work. Team members should work with each
other and not against each other. Individual and team reports will be required for each
assignment submission to document what tasks team each team members did and how long it
took them to complete. Any additional issues can be addressed in these reports.


## Deliverables
